# omwg_dev repo
The omwg_dev repository is dedicated to the Community Earth System Model ([CESM](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/)) Ocean Model Working Group ([OMWG](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/working-groups/ocean)) simulations, which includes:
- Development simulations (including case directories and model sandboxes);
- Production simulations (including OMIP-like and other intercomparison projects); 
- Relevant discussions to model development and diagnostics

## Development simulations
The list of development simulations can be found under [Issues](https://github.com/NCAR/omwg_dev/issues). 
  - Each simulation is represented as a GitHub issue. 
  - Simulations can be sorted with labels (for instance, compset: GMOM, CMOM). 
  - Please provide as many details as possible. 

## Discussions 
Discussions relevant to CESM/MOM6 development should be posted under [Discussions](https://github.com/NCAR/omwg_dev/discussions).
  
  - Discussions allow you to engage with other developers directly while staying on GitHub.
  - You can share the results of a single simulation or compare multiple simulations by using the Discussions feature.
  - To ensure the conversation remains productive and helpful, please keep your discussions organized by using relevant titles, applying labels, and refraining from mixing topics.

## Code of Conduct
We are committed to fostering a respectful and inclusive community for all participants.
- Our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/NCAR/omwg_dev/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) outlines our expectations for behavior and principles.
